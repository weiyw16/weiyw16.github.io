# Open VSP data
[OpenVSPdata](https://weiyw16.github.io/) aims to collect large Vertical Seismic Profiling data for deep learning tasks of geophysics.

We release (1) velocity models, (2) synthetic 2D2C VSP data (till Mar 2023).

We also provide scripts for data visualization and basic processing.

We welcome your usage and feedbacks!
